MATLAB implementation of k-shortest arc and vertex disjoint paths algorithms, based on
"Finding Arc and Vertex-Disjoint Paths in Networks" by Xie et al.

I implemented this for educational purposes - it is documented well, but not optmized.
The algorithms were only tested on some small test graphs, use with caution.
